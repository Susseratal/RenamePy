# RenamePy  
A python script for bulk renaming files that are all shuffled out of order. It will rename them to my format so if you're going to use this, you should probably change that. 

## Warranty  
I'm not looking to keep maintaining this, just use it when I need it, but if it's useful for you and you somehow don't have the python skills to maintain it yourself, drop me a line and I'll see what I can do
